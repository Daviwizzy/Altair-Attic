  description: `In 2012, the first star of what would become the Voyatek Group (vg) constellation was founded. From a passionate dream, rooted in the soils of Nigeria, we embarked on a journey with just two dedicated people. Our mission? To become the North Star for businesses in search of extraordinary experiences. Over time, our vision expanded, and our business evolved, but our core philosophy remained unshakeable. We were building a world where aspirations came alive, a realm that defied every impossibility.`,
